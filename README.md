# File Dialog

It's a part of my android application project.
That's why there is utils.js file with colors and dp calculator.
I didn't find anything like this on github or bitbucket.
It works not so well, but it works.
It's small and easy to use in your project.
Its default start folder is inside of application assets(when you run it on android device).
Its filepath text does not replace all "/".
